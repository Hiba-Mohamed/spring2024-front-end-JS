CSS Units:

16px = 12pt = 100% = 1em 
vh: veiwport Height
vw: viewport Width..

em: adapt from immediate parent
rem: adapt from root element..

Why 100% vw for some elements?
1.Inline(just occupy the required) vs 2. Block (by default the will occupy 100% of the width)

Flex Box Model:

Forms in HTML: They are used to take input from user
    <form> </form>
