Web browsers are actually called "User agents"

Attributes: that give extra functionality to the tags:

     <h1 style="color:red">Another heading</h1>
     ii) Internal CSS : WHen we define style in the <head> section of the document...
     iii) External CSS: Define a separate file with ".css" extenstion and link it to any page you want...
     iv) The browser itself - Its own style sheet..
    
Selectors:
1. Tag/type selectors: When we use tag name to style somethign
2. Class Selectors: when we define a  class of styles by using "." .demo{ } ... <h1 class = "demo">this one applied</h1>
3. ID selectors: when we define style for a unique element represented by an id. The style is defined by using #a1 for example...."#"

4. Contextual Selectors: div h1{ } // only those h1 will get this style which are under the div element not others...
5. Grouping selectors:
We can group multiple selectors together... h1,h2,h3{ }
