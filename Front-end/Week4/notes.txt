From HTML to the DOM:
    DOM: Document Object Model - API (Application Programming Interface?)[that allows communication between two application]
    
    DOM allows communication between HTML,CSS and JavaScript!

    DOM Tree:The tree that is created in the browser memory while we load a web page.

    HTML Nodes: All html elements are called HTML nodes.
    Text Nodes: All text values are called text nodes...

    Programming the DOM: Set of Objects, functions and properties allowing scrips to interact with and modify HTML. 

    Tasks that DOM does:
        1. Finding and getting references to elements in the page
         To get refernce to the elemtn that you want to change/alter/delete or create a new one.
          a) document.getElementById(id)
          b) document.querySelector(selector)
          c) docuemnt.querySelectorAll(selector)
          selector: i) "tag name" 
                    ii) Id selectors
                    iii) class selectors

        2. Creating elements and Modifying the DOM with JavaScript:
            document.createElement(name): creates a new element of type specified by the name.

            document.createTextNode(text): creates a new text node(the text withing an elements vs the element itself)


        3. Inspecting and modifying a DOM element with JavaScript
