Regular Expressions:

    provides a way to i)search, ii)update, iii) delete, iv)validate etc within a large of number of string by defining a specific pattern.

    Regular expression for recognizing multiple spaces in a big string.So that I can later replace those multiple spaces with ONLY one space.

    "hello         this is        a string             that contains       a lot of spaces".

    One or more - +
    Zero or more - *
    space - \s



let sentence =
  "hello   this is        a string that contains       a lot of tha hha spachaes la";

let re1 = /\s+/g;
// write re that finds "hat" in above string and replace it with space
let re2 = /t?hat?/g;
let re3 = /o\s?/g;
let re4 = /l(\w{2})?/g;
console.log(sentence.replace(re4, "X"));



----------------------------------


let str =
  "Alan Smith is a very good person. Alanu family reside in Toronto. Alans brothers are so and so.Alanxyx is a sportsman";

let re1 = /alan(\w{1})?/gi;

console.log(str.replace(re1, "Bob"));


let letters = ["a","b", "c"];
letters.forEach(function(value){console.log(value); });
