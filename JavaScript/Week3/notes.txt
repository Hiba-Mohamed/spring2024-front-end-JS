Rest operator:
... 

Dealing with Optional and Missing parameters:
  We use the missing value as truthy or falsy and take decision on them..

|| OR operator: Either side should be true to get a true output
&& AND operator: Both sides should be true to get a true output


1 AND 1  make 1
1 AND 0 make 0
0 AND 0 make 0

1 OR 0 make 1
0 OR 1 make 1
0 OR 0 make 0

Built-in/Global Functions:

parseInt()

Object Oriented JavaScript:
Strings:
    String is one object data type in JavaScript:


Arrays:

let arr=[1,3,4];
let arr2=new Array(5,6,7);

Unlike most other[C family , exception: C#[allowing mix type]] languages, JS array can contain any dataype including mix types:

let list=[0,"1","name",true];
Array Properties and Methods:

 arr.length - length of the array
 arr.push() to insert one element at the end of array
 arr.pop() to delete one value from the end of an array...

 arr.unshift() inserts at the beginning
 arr.shift() removes from the beginning

 arr.join("x"); returns a string created by joining(concatenating) all elements in the array with the given delimiter - split() is the opposite of join

 Methods for iterating accross the elemtns in an array:
  for loop:
  forEach Method:
  map function: creates and returs a new array by applying the given function on each value of the collection....


  Difference forEach and map function?????
  Difference map and filter?? map maps with each value and returns a boolean(if there is a condition in the function WHILEAS filter will filter out all the values that do not match the give condition..)
